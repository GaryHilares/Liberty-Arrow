## What is Ganbara Neba?
Ganbara Neba is the Chrome extension for blocking websites and improving productivity.

### Features
- **Multiple level:** Ganbara Neba allows you to put groups of blocked pages with individual rules and nested in multiple levels.

## Motivation
I like different Chrome extensions that help you to improve productivity by giving you different options to make you waste less time in unnecessary websites. However, I wanted to add multiple websites in different ways and these extensions only allowed to set a group of rules for all pages.

Ganbara Neba aims to solve this problem by providing group organization to your websites and allowing you to put different rules for them.

## What is Ganbara Neba?
Ganbara Neba is the Chrome extension for blocking websites and improving productivity.

### Features
- **Multiple level:** Ganbara Neba allows you to put groups of blocked pages with individual rules and nested in multiple levels.
- **Unlimited sites:** You wan't to block 50 different sites? No problem!
- **Substring blocking system:** You not only can block sites by adding the domain name, but also by adding any url's substring.

### Platforms
- Google Chrome.
- Firefox.
- Edge (Unofficial).
- Opera (Unofficial).
- Brave (Unofficial).

## Motivation
I like different browser extensions that help you to improve productivity by giving you different options to make you waste less time in unnecessary websites. However, I wanted to add multiple websites in different ways and these extensions only allowed to set a group of rules for all pages.

Ganbara Neba aims to solve this problem by providing group organization to your websites and allowing you to put different rules for them.
